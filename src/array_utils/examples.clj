;; ## What does this tell us?
;;
;; The benchmarks above haven't been done against tons of varied data.
;; It is thus possible we have reached local maxima for some of them.
;; Still, note the following:
;;
;; * The dot product is about as fast as Apache Common's digamma,
;; which is awesome, to say the least.

;; * Total execution time is about 5 milliseconds.

;; * Corollary: Reflection is (probably) eliminated for most cases,
;; even though the functions make little or no use of type hints. This
;; allows for more declarative programming and less type-hint hacking.
;;
;; * 7 macros and 21 functions, showing that it is easy to build upon the
;; primitives offered by this session.
;;
;; * We are able to compose them using Graph, suggesting they are
;; indeed somewhat composable. (No guarantees, though!)
